FlowFeed is a high efficient application that predicts, in real-time, the rideability of trails in the Northwest Arkansas area. The app is web-based using React/NodeJS and leveraging AWS and Lambda functions for caching, performance, and scalability. The application’s back-end is a mix of data analysis and machine learning that we leveraged to build an algorithm to predict the impact, decay, and overall status of a trail. It was essential for long-term growth that the API layer of the application be scalable beyond our initial app delivery and allow for new partners to leverage (and ultimately pay for) the data we’ve collected and algorithms we’ve developed.

### Technical Approach

- **Real-Time Predictions**: The app provides real-time data on trail conditions, using sophisticated algorithms to predict rideability. This helps users make informed decisions about trail usage.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built with a scalable API layer, the application is designed to support long-term growth. This architecture allows for seamless integration of new partners, enabling them to leverage—and potentially pay for—the data and algorithms we’ve developed.
- **AWS and Lambda Integration**: By incorporating AWS and Lambda functions, we ensure that the application is both efficient and scalable. These tools provide the necessary infrastructure for high-performance data processing and storage.

To support ongoing development and improvement, we utilized PowerBI for machine learning. This approach allows for consistent algorithm enhancement without the need to directly integrate, train, and maintain traditional machine learning models. Our expertise in project management, data analysis, UX/UI design, and React/NodeJS development has been instrumental in driving Flowfeed’s application forward.

### Key Features

- **Data Analysis and Machine Learning**: The app's backend is a blend of data analysis and machine learning, enabling us to build a predictive model for trail conditions.
- **User Experience**: A focus on intuitive UX/UI design ensures that users can easily access and interpret trail data.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Our team is committed to ongoing development and iteration, ensuring that the Flowfeed app remains at the forefront of trail rideability prediction technology.

Our work with Flowfeed demonstrates our commitment to delivering high-quality, scalable solutions that meet our clients' needs. Check out the [Flowfeed website](https://flowfeed.app) to see how we're making a difference in the mountain biking community.
