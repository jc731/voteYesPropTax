### Why We Need Your Support

- **Rising Costs:** Inflation has increased the cost of goods, services, and salaries since the last tax rate increase 40 years ago.
- **State Mandates Without Funding:** The state has mandated increases in school expenses, such as teacher salaries, without providing additional revenue.
- **Financial Gap:** Current revenues are insufficient to cover essential expenses, particularly educational resources.
- **Long-Term Sustainability:** Without additional funding, the district cannot sustain its operations and maintain the quality of education.

## Features of the Referendum

- **Investing in Education:** Additional funds will support teacher salaries, benefits, and educational programs.
- **Financial Responsibility:** Continued abatement of bonds used for construction, utilizing County Sales Tax money.
